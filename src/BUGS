2       OPEN    Trace frontend: no FPST input in the FUCOMPP instruction (and possibly others)
8       OPEN    Tracing pintool: read.C doesn't work
18      OPEN    Not modeling a limited number of multipliers and dividers
20      OPEN    Param MEM_REQ_BUFFER_PREF_WATERMARK is based on free list count (is it OK?)
21      OPEN    Mem ops that miss in dcache and can't get a mem req can saturate FUs
22      OPEN    make valgrind fails with trace frontend (currently disabled)
24      OPEN    McPAT interface ignores branch predictor parameters
25      OPEN    Unrealistic frontend modeling in Scarab assumes ICACHE_CYCLES = 1.
26      OPEN    The time unit of 1 femtosecond is hardcoded (should be param or define)
27      OPEN    Min voltage is assumed to equal the power model's ref voltage; need a better value.
28      OPEN    Replace fopen() calls with file_tag_fopen() for consistency
29      OPEN    Return address prediction is forced to be perfect with trace frontend
30      OPEN    DVFS, power intf, and perf pred assume L1 frequency for all cores
31      OPEN    The size of some memory queues doesn't matter; remove relevant params.
35      OPEN    op->state is never set to OS_DONE
37      OPEN    UPDATE_BP_OFF_PATH is off. Verify that it works at turn it on.
38      OPEN    Scarab cannot run /bin/ls using --exe
39      OPEN    McPAT interface does not work for multicore (Milad has details)
40      OPEN    Document DRAM input priority orders assumed by certain DRAM schedulers (TCM, ATLAS, batch)
42      OPEN    A uop of "setbe (%edx, %ecx, 2)" inst. overflows max number of input deps (h264ref @80bc3e9)
44      OPEN    fix DRAM refresh to issue one PRECHARGE command to all banks at once (Figure 41 in [Micron])
46      OPEN    Incremental build seems to break when simply changing a stat or a param name
47      OPEN    Ignoring scarab_power* files in get_stats() in scarab.pm may break power_intf
48      OPEN    In collect_dram_scheduler_stats(), only MRS_MEM_NEW reqs are considered
50      OPEN    cmp_cycle() etc. should be renamed, since, strictly speaking, they are not called every cycle
51      OPEN    bp_conf.c:support for cmp model might not be included. Each core must have a bpc_data (used to be a FIXME in bp_conf.c)
52      OPEN    vlp does not work for cmp model (multiple FIXMEs in the bp_dir_mech.c)
53      OPEN    cache_lib.c: ALL ASSERTs have proc_id 0
54      OPEN    it shouldn't be set here. It should be calculated based on branch instruction information. watch out Interrupt call also
55      OPEN    param_paser.c: there might be issues using with cmp
56      OPEN    pin_exec_driven_fe.c: look at sim.h, do we need to implement the operating modes? (simulation mode and fast forward mode).
57      OPEN    pref_stream.c:04/17/03 BUG !!! ins_model.c
